1) List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs
solution:
1.	Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website.            1.	NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.
2.	Javascript can only be run in the browsers.                                                      2. NodeJS code can be run outside the browser.
3.	It is basically used on the client-side.	                                                       3. It is mostly used on the server-side.
4.	Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.	                                 4. Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
5.	Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.	 5.Nodejs can only run in V8 engine of google chrome.
6.	Javascript is used in frontend development.	                                                     6.Nodejs is used in server-side development.

2) watch & summary 5 points - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc&ab_channel=JSConfbrowser
solution:
     parsing => DOM tree => render tree
1.browser components are bindings,rendering,platform,javascript VM.
2.rendering comprises of parsing,layout,painting etc.,
3.parsing is forgiving in natures,can be halted.
4.dom+cssom will be the actual represenation of what will be shown on the screen.
5.layout computes where a node will be on the screen  .
6.painting produces bitmap from each layer and it is uploadedto GPU as gesture.


3)To read - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags
Omitting the html, head, and body tags is certainly allowed by the HTML specs. 
but in good practise we should put all the tags .
it makes the spec more complex, which in turn makes it harder for browser authors to write correct implementations
is also may throw some small erorrs in IE.
so it is not necessary to put those rags but including these tags will be the best and good practise.


4) Execute the bellow code and write your description in txt file
        typeof(1)= number
        typeof(1.1)=number
        typeof('1.1')=string
        typeof(true)=boolean
        typeof(null)=object
        typeof(undefined)=undefined
        typeof([])= object
        typeof({})=object
        typeof(NaN)= number
        
 5)Read what is prototype
 A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.
 The goal of a prototype is to test products before sinking lots of time and money into the final product.
In software development, a prototype is a rudimentary working model of a product or information system, 
usually built for demonstration purposes or as part of the development process.
 a standard or typical example.
